 - I have uploaded the code to github
    - The repository is public and is located here: https://github.com/zachpattesonGT/Assignment-3
    - The file is named unsupervisedLearning.py

 - There are several libraries that need to be installed before running the script
    - sklearn
    - numpy
    - matplotlib

 - To run the script call the main() function
    - This will create the .png plots and print out some of the results to the console that were then taken and entered into excel for the graphs used in the report
